# Bike sharing Case Study
> This is to understood the driving factors (or driver variables) behind sharing bike, i.e. the variables which are highly corelated for target variable, using linear regression model we are checking which features are best and high corelated for booking the bike for rent.

## General Information
- **Background** : [**Sharing Bike**](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset) This dataset contains the hourly and daily count of rental bikes between years 2011 and 2012 in Capital bikeshare system with the corresponding weather and seasonal information.
- **Given** : Rental bikes between years 2011 and 2012
- **Business Problem** : Based on dataset related to customers analysis has to be made to helping the bike sharing company in decision making to provide more services based on the time and session.

## Conclusions
- Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues.
